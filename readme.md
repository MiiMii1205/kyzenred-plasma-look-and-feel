# Kyzenred
A full KDE theme based on gamer aesthetics and modern minimalism (Plasma look-and-feel component)

## Dependencies
- KDE >= 5

## Installation
Just put this repository in `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`. For the theme to work correctly you'll also need to fetch every other Kyzenred components.

**You'll also HAVE to install the Kyzenred file for each user, as the splashscreen require to be in a very specific directory to be able to fetch the current color scheme.**

## Updating the color scheme
Kyzenred comes with its official color scheme. That means that you can use Kyzenred as is.
However, Kyzenred was also designed to handle any KDE color scheme you'll throw at it.

To find out how to change your KDE color scheme, [click here](https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kde-workspace/kcontrol/colors/index.html)!

The Look-and-Feel component should play nicely with your current color scheme. Just remember that at this time it is very finicky and to keep it in the right directory!
